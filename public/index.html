        <p class="lead">Figuring out URLs for full text version of articles is a huge PITA. <br><br>

        There's <a href="https://doi.org">https://doi.org</a> for resolving DOIs to their full URLs on the web, and
        there's <a href="https://oadoi.org/">https://oadoi.org/</a> for the same but to OA versions.<br><br>

        However, there's no good tool for figuring out links to versions for text mining:
        typically either pdf or xml.<br><br>

        There is Crossref's TDM (text and data mining) bit, where publishers voluntarily
        deposit full text links into Crossref's metadata. However, very few publishers
        do this; some that do don't deposit correct metadata; some deposit but don't update
        when they change their URL structure (and publishers change URL stucture <strong>A LOT</strong>).<br><br>

        This API builds on work at <a href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pubpatterns">https://github.com/ropenscilabs/pubpatterns</a> - which
        is simply rules for building URLs.<br><br>

        This API allows you to give a DOI and get back full text URLs for PDF/XML/etc. if
        available.  And if they aren't available chip in and make it work.</p>
