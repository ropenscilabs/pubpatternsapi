        <strong>ftdoi.org</strong> allows you to give a DOI and get back full text URLs for PDF/XML/etc. if
        available.<br><br>

        The goal is to allow browser flow (aka: <code>ftdoi.org/doi</code>) like one often does with <code>https://doi.org</code> and <code>https://oadoi.org</code>, AND for programmatic flow in any programming language of choice (aka: <code>ftdoi.org/api/...</code>). Right now, only the programmatic flow is supported, but you can of course use the api in browser if you like.<br><br>

        Figuring out URLs for full text version of articles is a huge PITA. <br><br>

        There's <a href="https://doi.org">https://doi.org</a> for resolving DOIs to their full URLs on the web, and
        there's <a href="https://oadoi.org/">https://oadoi.org/</a> for the same but to OA versions.<br><br>

        However, there's no good tool for figuring out links to versions for text mining:
        typically either pdf or xml.<br><br>

        There is Crossref's TDM (text and data mining) bit, where publishers voluntarily
        deposit full text links into Crossref's metadata. However, very few publishers
        do this; some that do don't deposit correct metadata; some deposit but don't update
        when they change their URL structure (and publishers change URL stucture <strong>A LOT</strong>).

        This API builds on work at <a href="https://github.com/sckott/pubpatterns">https://github.com/sckott/pubpatterns</a> - which is simply rules for building URLs. The idea here is that we can crowd source the best knowledgee on correct URL patterns to full text versions of articles on a per publisher basis, either by crossref member number, or by DOI prefix. If there's publishers that aren't included, <a href="https://github.com/sckott/pubpatterns/pulls">send a PR</a>. <br><br>
